# java-algdat
Java implementation of different algorithms and datastructures.

Preparation for being a TA in IN2010 - datastructures and algorithms at the University of Oslo.

Most algorithms and datastructures are contained in a single file, including a single test often
randomly generated. Some algorithms use datastructures where its natural, for example
`Dijkstra.java` uses `PriorityQueue.java` in its implementation.

Other files are various utilities which generate tests, graphs and help visualize the
algorithms.
